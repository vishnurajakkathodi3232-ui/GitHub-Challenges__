Weekly Coding Challenge – Assignment Sheet 
Week 1 Challenge: The Secret Message Encoder 
Problem Statement 
A secret organization encodes their messages by rotating each word in a sentence. 
 For the i-th word in the sentence (1-based index), rotate its letters to the right by 
i positions. 
Example 
Input Sentence:  HELLO WORLD PYTHON 
Encoded Output:  OHELL DLRWO NPYTHO 
Explanation: 
 1st word → "HELLO" → rotate right by 1 → "OHELL" 
 2nd word → "WORLD" → rotate right by 2 → "DLRWO" 
 3rd word → "PYTHON" → rotate right by 3 → "NPYTHO" 
Task Requirements 
1. Write a Python program that: 
o Takes a sentence as input. 
o Encodes it using the rotation rule. 
o Prints the secret encoded message. 
2. The program should work for any number of words in a sentence. 
Extra Challenge (Bonus Marks) 
 Write a decoder function that takes the encoded message and retrieves the 
original sentence. 
 Ensure the program works with sentences of varying lengths. 
Input Format 
 A single line sentence (words separated by spaces). 
Output Format 
 The encoded secret message as a string.
