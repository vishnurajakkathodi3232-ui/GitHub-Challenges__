 Coding/GitHub Challenge – Week 3
 Problem Title: The Balanced Brackets Checker
 A string of brackets is considered balanced if: - Every opening bracket has a matching closing
 bracket of the same type. - Brackets are closed in the correct order. Brackets include: - Round: () 
Square: [] - Curly: {} You need to write a program that checks whether a given string of brackets is
 balanced or not.
 Examples:
 Input: {[()]}
 Output: Balanced
 Input: {[(])}
 Output: Not Balanced
 Input: ((()))
 Output: Balanced
 Task Requirements:
 1. Take a string of brackets as input.
 2. Use a stack-based approach to check if it is balanced.
 3. Print Balanced or Not Balanced.
 Extra Challenge (Bonus Marks):- Allow the string to contain letters/numbers along with brackets, and only validate the brackets.
 Example: a+(b*c)-{d/e} → Balanced.- Write your own stack implementation (using list or class) instead of using built-in shortcuts.
 Input Format:- A single string containing brackets (and optionally other characters).
 Output Format:- Balanced or Not Balanced
 Sample Test Cases:
 Test Case 1:
 Input: [()]{}{[()()]()}
 Output: Balanced
 Test Case 2:
 Input: [(])
 Output: Not Balance
