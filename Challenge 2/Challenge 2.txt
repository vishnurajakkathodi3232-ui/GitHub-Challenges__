Coding/GitHub Challenge – Week 2 
Problem Title: Number Spiral Pattern 
Problem Statement 
You are asked to generate a spiral pattern of numbers for a given size n. 
 The spiral starts with 1 in the top-left corner and fills numbers in a clockwise 
direction until reaching n × n. 
Example 
For n = 3 
1 2 3 
8 9 4 
7 6 5 
For n = 4 
1   2   3   4 
12  13  14  5 
11  16  15  6 
10   9   8  7 
Task Requirements 
1. Write a Python program that: 
o Takes an integer n as input. 
o Generates and prints the spiral matrix of size n × n. 
2. Ensure your code works for any n ≥ 2. 
Extra Challenge  
 Format the output so numbers align neatly in columns (use spacing). 
 Allow the user to choose clockwise or counter-clockwise spiral filling. 
Input Format 
 An integer n (size of the matrix). 
Output Format 
 An n × n spiral matrix printed line by line.
